1) THIS IS THE comprehension for extracting names from the json data
with open("data.json") as f:
     temp = json.load(f)
     data = temp['data']
     cols = temp['cols']

#this works
# names = []
# for n in range(0,len(data)):
#     if data[n][0] not in names:
#         names.append(data[n][0])
# print(names)


#this works because we are doing a comprehension using a set, which won't allow duplicates.
#Q: How to do this with a list?
names = {data[n][0] for n in range(0,len(data))}
print(names)
